## What is Vector Search?

Vector search is a method of finding items similar to a query based on numerical representations (embeddings). Instead of relying on exact keyword matches, vector search uses distances (e.g., cosine similarity) between embeddings to measure similarity.

### Use Cases
- **Image Search**: Find similar images to a given one.
- **Text Search**: Retrieve products based on textual descriptions.

---

## How Embeddings Work

Embeddings are dense numerical representations of data (e.g., text or images). In this project:

- **Image Embeddings**: Created using CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) to capture visual similarities.
- **Text Embeddings**: Generated using MiniLM, a lightweight transformer model for semantic understanding.

Embeddings enable meaningful comparisons between diverse data types (e.g., text vs. image).

---

## Database and Storage

Product information, including embeddings, is stored in an SQLite database (`products.db`). The schema includes:

- **Product Name**: Descriptive name of the product.
- **Description**: Textual information about the product.
- **Image Path**: Location of the product image.
- **Price**: Numeric value indicating the cost of the product.
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations for both text and image data.

SQLite provides a lightweight yet robust solution for storing structured data.

## Search Algorithm

The core search functionality relies on vector similarity:

1. **Query Vector**:
   - For image input, `img2vec` generates a query embedding.
   - For text input, `text2vec` generates a query embedding.

2. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Measures the angular similarity between the query embedding and stored embeddings.

3. **Result Ranking**:
   - Products are ranked based on similarity scores, and the most similar products are displayed.

## Extending the Project

### Ideas for Improvement
- **Advanced Models**: Integrate newer models for embeddings like OpenAI's latest APIs.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement a web API to handle dynamic product additions.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Add enhanced visualization for search results and rankings.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application using services like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

### Customization
- Replace the current models with domain-specific ones (e.g., a medical image embedding model for healthcare applications).
- Integrate with a NoSQL database for larger-scale deployments.
